# Tools

There are several popular documentation packages and tools available for documenting Angular projects. These tools can help generate documentation from your codebase, provide an interactive documentation experience, and automate the documentation process. Here are some commonly used Angular documentation packages:

1. Compodoc: Compodoc is a powerful documentation tool for Angular projects. It generates beautiful and highly customizable documentation based on the JSDoc comments in your code. Compodoc supports various features like navigation, search, live examples, and more.

2. TypeDoc: TypeDoc is a documentation generator specifically designed for TypeScript projects, including Angular. It automatically extracts information from TypeScript types, JSDoc comments, and decorators to generate API documentation. TypeDoc produces clean and well-organized documentation with support for modules, classes, methods, properties, and more.

3. AngularDoc: AngularDoc is an Angular-specific documentation tool built on top of TypeDoc. It extends TypeDoc's functionality to enhance the documentation experience for Angular developers. AngularDoc understands Angular-specific concepts like modules, components, services, directives, and pipes, providing specialized documentation for Angular projects.

4. Compodoc Markdown Plugin: Compodoc Markdown Plugin is an extension for Compodoc that allows you to export your generated documentation to Markdown format. This can be useful if you prefer Markdown as your documentation format or if you want to publish your documentation on platforms like GitHub or GitLab.

5. Compodoc Markdown Theme: Compodoc Markdown Theme is another extension for Compodoc that provides a clean and customizable Markdown theme for your documentation. It offers a sleek and responsive layout with support for syntax highlighting, navigation, and other useful features.

6. Storybook: While not strictly a documentation tool, Storybook is a popular tool for developing and documenting UI components in Angular and other frameworks. It allows you to build a library of interactive, isolated components with documentation, usage examples, and visual testing capabilities.

These packages and tools can help you generate comprehensive and well-structured documentation for your Angular projects. Each tool has its own features and customization options, so you can choose the one that best fits your project's needs and documentation preferences.
