# Password Security

Implementing password security in an Angular application involves several considerations to ensure that user passwords are stored and transmitted securely. Here are some steps to implement password security:

1. Password Complexity:

   - Define password complexity requirements such as minimum length, the inclusion of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
   - Enforce these requirements on the client-side during password creation or modification.

2. Password Hashing:

   - Never store passwords in plain text. Instead, use strong cryptographic hashing algorithms to convert passwords into irreversible hash values.
   - In Angular, you typically handle password hashing on the server-side, using technologies such as Node.js or .NET.

3. Salted Hashing:

   - Enhance password security by using salts. A salt is a random value added to the password before hashing.
   - Generate a unique salt for each user and combine it with their password before hashing.
   - Store the salt value along with the hashed password in the user database.

4. Strong Hashing Algorithms:

   - Use strong and secure hashing algorithms like bcrypt or Argon2 for password hashing.
   - These algorithms are specifically designed for password hashing and incorporate additional security features like computational complexity and memory hardening.

5. Password Validation:

   - Implement password validation on the client-side to ensure that users meet the specified complexity requirements.
   - Provide real-time feedback on password strength and give clear instructions for creating secure passwords.

6. Secure Transmission:

   - Ensure that password data is transmitted securely over HTTPS to protect against interception and eavesdropping.
   - Use SSL/TLS protocols to encrypt communication between the client and server.

7. Password Reset:

   - Implement a secure password reset mechanism to allow users to regain access to their accounts if they forget their passwords.
   - Use a combination of identity verification (e.g., email confirmation, security questions) and secure communication channels (e.g., temporary access tokens) to authenticate the user and allow them to set a new password.

8. Password Storage:

   - Store hashed passwords and their corresponding salt values securely in your user database.
   - Protect the database with proper access controls and encryption to prevent unauthorized access.

9. Security Audits and Best Practices:
   - Regularly review and update your password security measures to incorporate the latest best practices and industry standards.
   - Stay informed about emerging threats and vulnerabilities in password security and take appropriate measures to mitigate them.

Remember, password security is just one aspect of overall application security. It's essential to adopt a holistic approach by implementing other security measures, such as secure session management, input validation, and protection against common web vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).

## Things to consider

When implementing password security in a web application, it's crucial to consider various factors to ensure that user passwords are stored and handled securely. Here are some important things to consider:

1. Password Complexity:

   - Define password complexity requirements, such as minimum length, the inclusion of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
   - Educate users about the importance of strong passwords and provide guidelines to create secure passwords.

2. Password Hashing:

   - Never store passwords in plain text. Instead, use strong cryptographic hashing algorithms to convert passwords into irreversible hash values.
   - Use algorithms like bcrypt, Argon2, or scrypt, which are specifically designed for password hashing and incorporate salting and computational complexity.

3. Salted Hashing:

   - Enhance password security by using salts. A salt is a random value added to the password before hashing.
   - Generate a unique salt for each user and combine it with their password before hashing.
   - Store the salt value along with the hashed password in the user database.

4. Strong Hashing Algorithms:

   - Choose a strong and secure hashing algorithm that is computationally expensive and resistant to attacks like brute-force and rainbow table attacks.
   - Stay informed about the latest advancements and recommendations in password hashing algorithms and update your approach accordingly.

5. Password Validation:

   - Implement client-side and server-side password validation to enforce complexity requirements.
   - Provide real-time feedback to users during password creation or modification regarding password strength and requirements.

6. Secure Transmission:

   - Ensure that password data is transmitted securely over HTTPS to protect against interception and eavesdropping.
   - Use SSL/TLS protocols to encrypt communication between the client and server.

7. Password Reset:

   - Implement a secure password reset mechanism that verifies the identity of the user before allowing them to set a new password.
   - Use methods like email confirmation, security questions, or multi-factor authentication to authenticate the user during the password reset process.

8. Password Storage:

   - Store hashed passwords and their corresponding salt values securely in your user database.
   - Protect the database with strong access controls, encryption, and regular security audits.
   - Consider using secure password storage solutions like password vaults or key management systems.

9. Account Lockout and Brute-Force Protection:

   - Implement mechanisms to detect and prevent brute-force attacks on user accounts.
   - Track failed login attempts and temporarily lock user accounts after a certain number of failed attempts within a specified time frame.

10. Regular Password Updates:

    - Encourage users to update their passwords periodically to enhance security.
    - Implement policies to prompt users to change their passwords after a certain period or in case of suspected security breaches.

11. Security Education and Awareness:

    - Educate users about the importance of password security, the risks of using weak passwords, and best practices for maintaining secure passwords.
    - Provide guidance on avoiding common pitfalls like password reuse and sharing.

12. Security Audits and Best Practices:
    - Regularly review and update your password security measures to incorporate the latest best practices and industry standards.
    - Stay informed about emerging threats and vulnerabilities in password security and take appropriate measures to mitigate them.

By considering these factors, you can establish robust password security practices in your web application, protecting user accounts and maintaining the confidentiality of their passwords.

## Packages

In Angular, there are several packages available that can help with password security-related functionalities. While there may not be specific packages solely dedicated to password security, you can leverage general-purpose security libraries and packages that provide features and utilities for implementing secure authentication and password handling. Here are a few commonly used packages in Angular:

1. bcryptjs:

   - GitHub: https://github.com/dcodeIO/bcrypt.js
   - This package provides bcrypt hashing functionality, which is commonly used for secure password hashing.
   - It offers a simple API to hash passwords and compare them with hashed values.

   - GitHub: https://github.com/brix/crypto-js
   - crypto-js is a comprehensive cryptographic library that offers various hashing algorithms, encryption, and decryption functionalities.
   - It provides utilities for implementing secure password hashing and other cryptographic operations.

3. ngx-webstorage:

   - GitHub: https://github.com/zefoy/ngx-webstorage
   - ngx-webstorage simplifies working with browser storage mechanisms like localStorage and sessionStorage in Angular.
   - You can use this package to securely store and manage sensitive information related to password security, such as tokens or salts.
